The future scope of the Docstash Application is,

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Storage Enhancement: }We can use more reliable SSD (solid-state drive or solid-state disk) instead of HDD, which is currently being used.

\item \textbf{Enterprise Storage: }Along with personal storage, the concept can be extended to Enterprise data storage.

\item \textbf{Mobile Application: }Docstash can also be made available to users through mobile application for Android and iOS users.

\item \textbf{File Synchronization: }Automatic file sync can be implemented so that user do not have to upload files manually.
\item \textbf{Security: }We can use more security methods along with AES256 encryption standards to guarantee security and privacy.

\end{itemize}
